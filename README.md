# PhotOPT - A web-based Application 
PhotOPT is an image repository. Users can upload images in their account and make them publicly viewable or for private use only. 

This repository also gives all users access to other user's images that they mark as publicly sharable. To view these publicly sharable images, you do need to set up an account though. We want to keep all these images within the community.
